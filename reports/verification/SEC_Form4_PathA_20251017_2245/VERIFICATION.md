# Verification Report — Path A SEC Form 4 Ingest

**Timestamp:** 2025-10-17 22:46 UTC

## Summary
- Verification **failed early** because mandatory environment variables were not provided (`SEC_USER_AGENT`, `TEST_FORM4_XML_URL`/`TEST_FORM4_TXT_URL`).
- Only preflight checks that do not require external inputs were executed.
- No database or network operations were performed.

## Steps & Results
1. ✅ Repo status captured (branch `work`, commit `638c5f9`, clean workspace).
2. ✅ Python version confirmed: 3.11.12.
3. ✅ Verified `flows/ingest_sec_form4.py` exists.
4. ✅ CLI help executed; `--date` flag documented.
5. ❌ Environment validation failed — `SEC_USER_AGENT` missing; required filing URL absent.
6. ⏭️ Dry-run ingest skipped due to missing environment prerequisites.
7. ⏭️ CLI variant checks skipped.
8. ⏭️ Persistence ingest skipped (database URL missing).

## Next Steps
- Provide values for:
  - `SEC_USER_AGENT` (per SEC API requirements).
  - `TEST_FORM4_XML_URL` or `TEST_FORM4_TXT_URL` (real Form 4 filing).
  - Optionally, `DATABASE_URL` to verify persistence.
- Re-run the verification once the environment variables are set.
