# Agentic Quant Loop

## Autonomous AI Feature Learning and Signal Discovery for Quantitative Finance

### Vision Summary

We propose an advanced closed-loop system that combines state-of-the-art financial representation learning with autonomous, agentic GPT-5-level reasoning to discover, evaluate, and refine predictive features for trading strategies.

At the core is a tight integration of:

* Self-supervised embeddings (e.g., TS2Vec, DeepLOB, InceptionTime)
* Symbolic regression and neuro-symbolic distillation (e.g., PySR)
* Reinforcement learning for feature search
* Regime-aware backtesting
* Vector database for similarity-based pattern recall
* A GPT-5-style planner-agent that reasons over strategy outcomes, rewrites feature pipelines, and orchestrates continual learning

> This system is designed to not only discover alpha, but to learn how to learn alpha.

## System Architecture

### 1. Raw Data Pipeline

* Ingests tick, LOB, SEC filings, dark pool, and macroeconomic data
* Cleans and segments data into context windows for feature processing

### 2. Feature Generator Layer

* **Deep encoders:** TS2Vec, DeepLOB, InceptionTime for latent embeddings
* **Symbolic regressors:** PySR, AI-Feynman for equation discovery
* **Topological models:** Persistent homology for regime topology analysis
* **Change-point & regime detection:** BOCPD, HMMs, structural breaks

### 3. Vector Database Layer

* Stores embeddings and symbolic fingerprints
* Enables vector similarity search:

  * *"When did we last see a signal like this?"*
* Used by both models and the agent for analogical reasoning and retrieval

### 4. Backtesting & Evaluation

* Rolling out-of-sample backtests using strategy-defined signals
* Risk-adjusted metrics:

  * Sharpe, Sortino, drawdown, t-stats
* Regime-specific scorecards
* Continuous monitoring of signal decay

### 5. Agentic Planning Layer (GPT-5)

* Reads feature logs, backtest diagnostics, and regime outcomes
* Plans new feature transformations, symbolic pipelines, and model changes
* Calls tools to:

  * Retrain models
  * Evolve features
  * Prune vector DB
  * Re-index drifted embeddings
* Learns through outcome-aware feedback:

  * Failing features are deprecated or evolved

### 6. Retraining Loop

* Triggered via GPT agent or scheduled intervals
* Updates all layers: encoders, models, memory, scorecards
* Maintains rolling validation and self-supervision over time

## Why This Advances the State of the Art

This architecture builds on foundational research in self-supervised time series embeddings, symbolic discovery, and vector-based retrieval. It augments them with:

* Autonomous planning and tool use (agentic GPT)
* Self-rewriting pipelines
* Context-aware and regime-aware signal adaptation
* Continual validation across historical and emerging data regimes

> The result: a system that doesn’t just generate features—it thinks about features.

It reasons over failure, adapts to new market conditions, generalizes across economic cycles, and curates its own evolving alpha library.

## Example Applications and Use Cases

* Intraday or daily alpha signal discovery
* Insider trading pattern correlation via vector similarity
* Systematic regime shift detection
* Adaptive hedge overlays and reactive stop logic
* Meta-portfolio optimization using learned feature clusters

## Conclusion

With a GPT-5-level agent embedded into a live-feedback, backtest-grounded feature discovery loop, this system becomes a self-reinforcing alpha machine—capable not only of learning from market data, but of strategically evolving its own intelligence to navigate market complexity over time.
