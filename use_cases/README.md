# Use Case Playbooks

Add concrete instantiations of the framework here. Each use case should
include:

- `manifest.yaml` describing data sources, labelling scheme, and KPIs.
- `features/` containing specialised feature generators.
- `reports/` summarising production guardrails and SLOs.

Agents rely on these manifests to switch objectives and share artefacts across
scenarios such as insider trading, earnings drift, or liquidity shocks.
