# Agentic Quantitative Framework Overview

The Agentic Quantitative Framework couples LangGraph-driven planners with
quantitative research primitives. Each iteration guides the platform through
feature ideation, backtesting, and vector memory maintenance so that new
signals can be evaluated safely.

Key pillars:

- **Agentic planners** coordinate feature engineering, testing, and deployment
  using LangGraph state machines.
- **Modular components** expose feature generators, Supabase-backed vector
  memory, and reusable backtest scenarios.
- **Local-first development** ensures every workflow can run on a laptop using
  Docker, Supabase CLI, and Poetry.

Use this overview to orient new contributors before diving into deeper design
docs.
