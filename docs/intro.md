# Next + Supabase Starter Overview

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **next-supabase-i18n-a11y-starter**. These docs explain how to bootstrap and maintain a fresh Next.js + Supabase project that follows the specifications in this repository.

Use the navigation sidebar to explore:

- The legacy agent playbook, master specification, and environment guides that now live under `archive/legacy-starter-docs/docs/specs/`.
- A quick reference to those archived resources on the [Legacy specs index](specs/README.md).
- Decision records, QA guidance, and optional UI overlays that remain in the `archive/legacy-starter-docs/docs/specs/` tree for historical context.

The README provides a quick-start prompt for agents. Humans should start with the **Spec** and **Agents** docs to understand expectations before running the automation.
