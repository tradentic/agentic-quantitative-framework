## Overview

Each use case combines Supabase data tables, LangGraph tooling, and Prefect flows to automate a specific research or trading workflow. Use this catalogue to explore existing implementations and discover how to contribute new ones.

## Available Use Cases

- [Insider Trading Loop](../../use_cases/insider_trading/Agentic%20Quant%20Loop.md) â€“ Demonstrates how regulatory filings trigger feature generation, vector refreshes, and backtests through the shared infrastructure.

## Adding a New Use Case

1. Create a new directory under `use_cases/<your_use_case>/` with documentation and data-loading scripts.
2. Define ingestion pipelines that land data in Supabase tables; register any RPC helpers inside `supabase/sql/` or migrations.
3. Implement feature generation or embedding scripts under `features/` and register them via the LangGraph `propose_new_feature` tool.
4. Deploy Prefect flows for orchestration (embedding refresh, pruning, backtests) and document how to run them in this catalogue.
